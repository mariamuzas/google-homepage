Hello,

This is my first project with HTML and CSS, just Google's homepage with some little tweaks.
It has been a small challenge to practice some basics that I've learnt recently about HTML and CSS.

I'm sure that there are some major mistakes, so if anyone is reading this code I would really appreciate if you could tell me what is wrong and where I can improve, or just some little guidelines about it.

Thank you very much for reading,
Maria
